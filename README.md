# README File Generator

By Shane Mindreau

## Description

This app uses Node npm’s Inquirer package to ask the user a series of questions which are used to build README.md files for any app or project the user need’s it for. This app works entirely on javascript code and is meant to save people time through a hassle free way of making a README file.

## Installation

Installation is simple. All you need to do is clone the GitHub repository and install Node if you do not already have it.

## Usage

In order to use the app you will need to open an integrated terminal and have your current directory be the folder of the cloned GitHub repository. Then simply run: **node index.js**

## Features

Although most sections of the README are guaranteed to be made, a feature of the app is that the ‘Table of Contents’ section is optional, and the user can decide based on a yes or no question if they want to include it. They are also given the choice to include a screenshot in the ‘Usage’ section, however, if they decide to include it they will need to edit the file path of the image markdown code used to that of their chosen image.
